1. Could I have more details about the disney ticket(s)? It's not clear to me if this is a single day ticket, multi-day ticket, multi-park, etc.
2. Can we schedule some follow-up time with the engineers on the teams that I would be working with day-to-day? I'd like to ask questions revolving specifically around developer productivity actions.
3. I'd like to take some time off between my current role and this possible new role. How flexible can we be with a start date?
4. Is this benefits and compensation package flexible at all? Is this absolutely the best offer that is possible or is there any wiggle room?
5. CapitalOne onsite coming in October 4th, can we push a commitment to an offer until I hear back from them?
